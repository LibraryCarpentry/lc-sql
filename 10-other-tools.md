## Other database tools

For this lesson, [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org), a free open source database tool was used, but there are other tools available, both proprietary and open. A helpful [comparison of database tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_database_tools) is available via Wikipedia.

[SqliteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) is the free online database tool offered as an alternative to DB Browser for this lesson. In addition to SqliteOnline, there is [data.world](https://data.world) which also allows you to work online with SQL and ([library](https://data.world/datasets/library)) datasets and includes a [tutorial](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/basic/intro.html). SQL use in [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), a popular spreadsheet application, is even a possibility, demonstrated via [Ben Collin's tutorial](https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-query-sql/). There is also a business standard software package called, [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/), which has a community edition that can be downloaded free.
